With this utility you can use the symlink application Microsoft Windows has well hidden inside the cmd.exe app.

The goal is just make it easier to create symbolic links, hard links, or directory junctions, using a pretty simple interface, so no more bogus command line to do it...

This application needs **.Net Framework 3.5** to run (SP1 recommended) and as of 7/26/2010 this software **will only work under Windows Vista or 7**, Windows XP doesn't have the mklink command inside the cmd.exe app. I'll look for a workaround for this, but it isn't promising that I will find it...

If you encounter a bug, please let me know, I will look into it when I have the time, I have a really tight schedule right now...

Thanks for your downloads and support, hope you like it!
